# Visual Design Testing Skill

> **Based on NN/g Methodology**: Attitudinal and Behavioral Testing for Visual Design

## What is it?

This skill provides structured methods for testing visual design effectiveness—from capturing first impressions with 5-second tests to measuring brand perception through desirability testing, and validating design decisions with A/B testing.

## Why use it?

- **Validate Assumptions**: You and your team are not the users—test with real audience
- **Brand Alignment**: Verify design expresses intended brand traits
- **Reduce Risk**: Catch perception issues before development
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Choose between design variations with evidence
- **Measure Impact**: Understand how visual design affects user behavior

---

# Part 1: When to Test Visual Design

## Testing Throughout the Design Process

### Early Design Phase (Concept Validation)
- **Purpose**: Validate initial design direction
- **Methods**: 5-second tests, preference testing
- **Focus**: First impressions, brand perception
- **Fidelity**: Low to medium (wireframes, mockups)
- **Participants**: 5-8 per variation

### Mid-Development Phase (Refinement)
- **Purpose**: Compare and refine design variations
- **Methods**: Preference testing, closed word choice
- **Focus**: Specific element effectiveness
- **Fidelity**: Medium to high (styled mockups)
- **Participants**: 8-12 per variation

### Pre-Launch Phase (Validation)
- **Purpose**: Final validation before release
- **Methods**: A/B testing, full usability + visual questions
- **Focus**: Behavioral impact, task success
- **Fidelity**: High (production-ready)
- **Participants**: 12+ for behavioral, more for quantitative

---

# Part 2: Attitudinal Testing Methods

Attitudinal methods gather self-reported thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Use these to evaluate brand alignment and first impressions.

## 2.1 The 5-Second Test

### Purpose
Capture users' "gut reaction" or first impression of a design. Five seconds is enough to form an impression of visual style but too short for reading details.

### When to Use
- Validating overall visual direction
- Testing landing page effectiveness
- Checking if key messages are noticed
- Evaluating brand perception at first glance

### How to Conduct

**Preparation**:
- Select the screen/design to test
- Prepare 3-5 follow-up questions
- Decide on moderated vs unmoderated format
- Recruit 5-15 participants per design

**Important Rule**: Do NOT warn participants that the design will only be shown for 5 seconds. This primes them to memorize rather than react naturally.

**Session Flow**:
1. Provide brief context if needed (e.g., "This is a banking website")
2. Display the design for exactly 5 seconds
3. Hide the design
4. Ask follow-up questions immediately

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- What do you remember seeing?
- What do you think this company/product does?
- What three words would you use to describe what you saw?
- What stood out to you most?
- How did the design make you feel?
- Would you trust this company? Why or why not?

### Analyzing Results
- Look for patterns in what participants remember
- Note which elements were most noticed (good for "One Highlight" validation)
- Categorize descriptive words as positive, negative, or neutral
- Compare against your intended brand traits

### Staylook-Specific 5-Second Questions
- Did participants notice THE one highlight (Expressive element)?
- Did the curved aesthetic create intended warmth/friendliness?
- Was the visual hierarchy clear (what stood out first, second)?
- Did the minimal approach feel premium or empty?

---

## 2.2 First-Click Test

### Purpose
Determine if users can quickly find what they need based on visual design. Tests visual hierarchy, information architecture visibility, and CTA effectiveness.

### When to Use
- Testing navigation visibility
- Evaluating CTA placement and prominence
- Validating visual hierarchy guides users correctly
- Checking if important features are findable

### How to Conduct

**Preparation**:
- Define 3-5 specific tasks users should find
- Prepare static screenshots of the interface
- Decide on click tracking method
- Recruit 8-12 participants per design

**Session Flow**:
1. Present the design (static image)
2. Give a specific task: "Find where you would click to [action]"
3. Record the first click location
4. Stop after first click (don't let them browse)
5. Repeat for each task

**Example Tasks**:
- "Where would you click to create a new project?"
- "Find where you would access your account settings"
- "Locate the main action you can take on this page"

### Analyzing Results
- Calculate success rate per task (clicked correct area)
- Create click heat maps showing where users clicked
- Identify areas of confusion (scattered clicks)
- Note if "One Highlight" (Expressive element) draws clicks when intended

### Staylook-Specific First-Click Analysis
- Did the Expressive button attract clicks for main actions?
- Did Standard buttons get clicked for secondary actions?
- Did radius hierarchy create expected visual grouping?
- Were users drawn to the correct focal point?

---

## 2.3 Preference Testing

### Purpose
Compare two or three design variations to understand which resonates better with users and why.

### When to Use
- Choosing between design directions
- Validating design decisions with data
- Testing specific element variations (color, layout, etc.)
- Narrowing down from multiple concepts

### How to Conduct

**Preparation**:
- Limit to 2-3 design variations maximum
- Ensure differences are significant (not subtle font changes)
- Change only one major element between versions to isolate impact
- Prepare probing questions
- Recruit 8-15 participants

**Key Rule**: Differences must be noticeable to non-designers. Subtle variations (minor font size, similar colors) will confuse participants.

**Key Rule**: Randomize or counterbalance the order of versions shown to each participant. First-seen designs can bias responses.

**Session Flow**:
1. Show first design variation
2. Allow participant to study it (not timed)
3. Show second design variation
4. Ask which they prefer and why
5. Probe for specific reasons

**Preference Questions**:
- Which design do you prefer? Why?
- Which design feels more [trustworthy/professional/modern]?
- Which design would you expect from a [type of company]?
- What specifically influenced your choice?

### Analyzing Results
- Tally preference counts per variation
- Categorize reasons into themes
- Note which specific elements drove preferences
- Identify any audience segment differences

### Staylook-Specific Preference Questions
- Which design feels more premium?
- Which design's highlight (Expressive element) is more effective?
- Which design has better visual balance?
- Which curved aesthetic feels more appropriate?

---

## 2.4 Post-Usability Visual Questions

### Purpose
Gather visual design feedback after participants have interacted with the product, combining behavioral experience with aesthetic assessment.

### When to Use
- Limited time/resources for separate visual test
- Want holistic impression after use
- Testing production or near-production designs
- Combining usability and visual evaluation

### How to Conduct

**Critical Rule**: Present behavioral tasks FIRST, aesthetic questions LAST. Asking about aesthetics first biases behavioral responses.

**Session Flow**:
1. Conduct normal usability testing tasks
2. After all tasks complete, transition to visual questions
3. Ask about overall aesthetic impression
4. Probe about specific visual elements

**Post-Task Visual Questions**:
- Now that you've used the interface, how would you describe its visual design?
- Did the design help or hinder your ability to complete tasks?
- What visual elements did you notice most?
- Does the design match your expectations for this type of product?
- How does this compare visually to similar products you use?

### Analyzing Results
- Note if aesthetic responses align with task experience
- Identify visual elements mentioned as helping/hindering
- Compare visual impressions vs actual task performance
- Document the "aesthetic-usability effect" (positive aesthetic = forgive issues)

# Part 3: Assessment Methods

These are ways to structure and measure user reactions to visual design.

## 3.1 Open-Ended Preference Explanation

### Description
Participants explain in their own words why they like or dislike a design.

### When to Use
- Early exploration when you don't know what matters to users
- Discovering unexpected perspectives
- Understanding reasoning behind preferences
- Moderated sessions where follow-up is possible

### Questions to Ask
- How would you describe this design?
- What do you like about this design?
- What do you dislike about this design?
- What feeling does this design give you?
- What does this design remind you of?

### Analyzing Responses
- Identify recurring themes across responses
- Categorize feedback as positive, negative, neutral
- Note unexpected perspectives or concerns
- Screen out purely subjective preferences ("I like blue")

### Limitations
- Unmotivated participants may give brief/vague responses
- Risky in unmoderated settings (no follow-up possible)
- Analysis can be subjective

---

## 3.2 Open Word Choice

### Description
Participants list several words that describe the design, providing specific but open-ended feedback.

### When to Use
- Want specific descriptors without constraining responses
- Need to discover how users naturally describe the design
- Testing brand perception
- Have time for analysis

### Questions to Ask
- What three to five words come to mind when you see this design?
- How would you describe this design to a friend?
- What adjectives would you use for this interface?

### Analyzing Responses
- Create a table of all words collected
- Categorize as positive, negative, neutral
- Group synonyms and similar words
- Compare against your target brand traits

**Example Analysis Table**:

| Positive | Negative | Neutral |
|----------|----------|---------|
| clean | plain | simple |
| modern | boring | basic |
| professional | cold | corporate |
| elegant | sterile | minimal |

### Does It Match Target Traits?
- Target: "Trustworthy, Premium, Friendly"
- Received: "Clean, Professional, Cold"
- Gap: "Friendly" not perceived, "Cold" is opposite

---

## 3.3 Closed Word Choice (Desirability Testing)

### Description
Participants choose words from a predefined list of terms. Also known as the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit method.

### When to Use
- Need to verify specific brand traits are perceived
- Want easy comparison across designs or audiences
- Have established target brand attributes
- Need quantifiable results

### How to Construct Word List

**Include These Categories**:
1. **Target Brand Traits**: Words you WANT users to choose (3-5 words)
2. **Opposite Traits**: Contradictory/negative qualities
3. **Distractor Words**: Other possible attributes (not target, not negative)

**Total Words**: 20-30 words in the list

**Staylook Example Word List**:

| Target Traits | Opposite Traits | Distractors |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Premium | Cheap | Professional |
| Curved | Sharp | Modern |
| Minimal | Cluttered | Corporate |
| Expressive | Boring | Functional |
| Friendly | Cold | Elegant |
| Trustworthy | Suspicious | Simple |
| Editorial | Messy | Traditional |
| Refined | Rough | Bold |

### Session Flow
1. Show the design
2. Present the randomized word list
3. Ask: "Choose 3-5 words that best describe this design"
4. Allow participant to view design while choosing (important)
5. Ask why they chose each word

**Important**: Randomize word order for each participant in case they don't read the full list.

**Important**: Don't combine with 5-second test—by the time they read the list, they won't remember a 5-second design.

### Analyzing Results
- Count frequency of each word selected
- Calculate percentage of participants choosing target traits
- Compare target traits vs opposite traits
- Identify any unexpected popular descriptors

---

## 3.4 Numerical Rating Scale

### Description
Participants rate specific design qualities on a numbered scale (e.g., 1-5 or 1-7).

### When to Use
- Need quantitative data
- Want to track perception over time
- Comparing designs with statistical rigor
- Have larger participant pool (15+)
- Already know what qualities to measure

### How to Structure

**Choose 3-5 Brand Traits to Rate**:
- Don't measure too many—keeps questionnaire short
- Focus on most important qualities
- Use qualities validated in earlier qualitative research

**Scale Format**:
- Use 5-point or 7-point scales
- Label the endpoints clearly
- Use semantic differential (opposite traits at each end)

**Example Rating Questions**:

Rate this design on the following scales:

| Quality | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cheap ←→ Premium | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Boring ←→ Engaging | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Generic ←→ Unique | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Cold ←→ Friendly | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Cluttered ←→ Clean | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |

### Analyzing Results
- Calculate mean and median for each quality
- Calculate standard deviation (consistency of perception)
- Compare scores across design variations
- Track scores over design iterations
- Use statistical tests for comparison (t-test, ANOVA)

### Staylook Rating Qualities
- Cheap ←→ Premium
- Sharp ←→ Curved
- Cluttered ←→ Minimal
- Boring ←→ Expressive
- Cold ←→ Friendly
- Amateur ←→ Professional
- Confusing ←→ Clear

# Part 4: Behavioral Testing Methods

Behavioral methods observe how users interact with the design. Use these to assess how visual design affects task success and user behavior.

## 4.1 Eyetracking Studies

### Purpose
Track where users look and for how long to understand which elements attract attention and how users scan the interface.

### When to Use
- Evaluating layout effectiveness
- Testing CTA visibility and prominence
- Validating visual hierarchy
- Understanding scan patterns

### What Eyetracking Reveals
- **Fixations**: Where users focus attention
- **Gaze paths**: Order of elements noticed
- **Heat maps**: Cumulative attention patterns
- **Areas of interest (AOI)**: Key element attention metrics

### Key Questions to Answer
- Does the "One Highlight" (Expressive element) attract first attention?
- Is visual hierarchy guiding eyes in the right order?
- Are important elements being noticed?
- Are users distracted by non-essential elements?

### Alternatives to Eyetracking Equipment
- First-click testing (approximates attention)
- Ask participants to describe what they noticed
- Think-aloud protocols during viewing
- Post-viewing recall questions

### Staylook Eyetracking Questions
- Does the single Expressive element draw first fixation?
- Do radius-nested containers create expected grouping?
- Is the Standard vs Expressive distinction creating hierarchy?
- Does the curved aesthetic affect scan patterns?

---

## 4.2 A/B Testing for Visual Design

### Purpose
Compare two design versions in production to measure real behavioral impact.

### When to Use
- Measuring conversion impact of visual changes
- Testing specific element variations
- Need statistical confidence in design decisions
- Have sufficient traffic for statistical significance

### What to A/B Test

**Visual Elements Worth Testing**:
- CTA button color (Expressive vs Standard)
- Layout variations
- Typography choices
- Image styles
- Card vs list layouts
- Hero section designs

**Metrics to Measure**:
- Click-through rate on key CTAs
- Conversion rate
- Time on page
- Scroll depth
- Bounce rate
- Task completion rate

### A/B Testing Guidelines
- Change one major element at a time
- Run test until statistical significance reached
- Ensure adequate sample size (use A/B test calculators)
- Test during representative time periods
- Document what was changed and why

### Staylook A/B Test Ideas
- Expressive button vs Standard button for main CTA
- Different radius sizes
- Different "One Highlight" placements
- Intensity scale variations (Muted vs Calm backgrounds)
- Typography contrast levels

---

# Part 5: Staylook-Specific Testing

## Testing the "One Highlight" Principle

### Questions to Validate
- Is THE one Expressive element noticed first?
- Does it draw appropriate action/clicks?
- Is there confusion from competing elements?
- Does limiting to one highlight improve focus?

### Testing Methods
- 5-second test: "What stood out most?"
- First-click test: Task for main action
- Eyetracking: First fixation on Expressive element
- Preference test: Page with one highlight vs multiple

---

## Testing Radius Hierarchy Perception

### Questions to Validate
- Does nesting (32→24→16→pill) create visual grouping?
- Do pill buttons feel distinct from other elements?
- Is the curved aesthetic perceived as intended (warm, friendly)?

### Testing Methods
- Open word choice: See if "curved," "soft," "friendly" appear
- Rating scale: Sharp ←→ Curved
- Preference test: Strict hierarchy vs inconsistent radii

---

## Testing Standard vs Expressive Balance

### Questions to Validate
- Is 90/10 Standard/Expressive ratio balanced?
- Does Standard color feel like the "main" color?
- Is Expressive color special and attention-grabbing?

### Testing Methods
- Desirability testing with Staylook word list
- First-click tests for Expressive buttons
- 5-second tests for first impression

---

## Testing Intensity Scale

### Questions to Validate
- Is Muted → Calm → Vibrant progression perceivable?
- Do state changes (hover, active) feel natural?
- Is the scale creating intended depth?

### Testing Methods
- Task-based testing with attention to state awareness
- Post-usability questions about interactive feedback
- Rating scale: Flat ←→ Dimensional

---

# Part 8: Quick Reference

## Method Selection Guide

| Goal | Best Method |
|------|-------------|
| Test first impression | 5-Second Test |
| Test findability/hierarchy | First-Click Test |
| Compare design options | Preference Testing |
| Verify brand traits perceived | Closed Word Choice |
| Discover unknown perceptions | Open Word Choice |
| Get quantitative data | Rating Scales |
| Measure real behavior | A/B Testing |
| Understand attention flow | Eyetracking |

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Warning about 5-second tests**: Primes unnatural memorization
- **Showing similar designs**: Differences must be obvious to non-designers
- **Order bias**: Always randomize/counterbalance design order
- **Leading questions**: Don't ask "Do you like this?"
- **Small samples for quantitative**: Get 15+ for rating scales
- **Aesthetic before usability**: Always test behavior first in combined studies
- **Too many words in closed choice**: Keep list to 20-30 words

---

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- Test with real target users, not colleagues
- Use structured methods, not just "do you like it?"
- Randomize order of design variations
- Allow design viewing during word selection
- Combine multiple methods for robust insights
- Test early and iterate

**Don't**:
- Assume your taste matches users
- Test subtle differences imperceptible to non-designers
- Ask about aesthetics before usability testing
- Use only one method
- Skip follow-up "why" questions
- Test once and consider it validated
