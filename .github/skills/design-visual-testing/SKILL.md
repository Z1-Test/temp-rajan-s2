# Visual Design Testing Skill

> **Based on NN/g Methodology**: Attitudinal and Behavioral Testing for Visual Design

## What is it?

This skill provides structured methods for testing visual design effectiveness—from capturing first impressions with 5-second tests to measuring brand perception through desirability testing, and validating design decisions with A/B testing.

## Why use it?

- **Validate Assumptions**: You and your team are not the users—test with real audience
- **Brand Alignment**: Verify design expresses intended brand traits
- **Reduce Risk**: Catch perception issues before development
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Choose between design variations with evidence
- **Measure Impact**: Understand how visual design affects user behavior

# Part 1: When to Test Visual Design

## Testing Throughout the Design Process

| Phase | Purpose | Methods | Fidelity | Participants |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Early** | Validate direction | 5-second, preference | Low-medium | 5-8/variation |
| **Mid** | Refine variations | Preference, word choice | Medium-high | 8-12/variation |
| **Pre-Launch** | Final validation | A/B testing, usability | Production | 12+ for behavioral |

# Part 2: Testing Methods Overview

## Attitudinal Methods (Self-Reported)

Gather thoughts, feelings, and opinions to evaluate brand alignment.

### 5-Second Test
- **Purpose**: Capture gut reaction, first impression
- **Duration**: Show design exactly 5 seconds
- **Key Rule**: Do NOT warn about 5-second limit
- **Questions After**: What do you remember? What stood out? How did it feel?
- **Sample Size**: 5-15 per design

### First-Click Test
- **Purpose**: Test if users find what they need
- **Method**: Show static image, ask "where would you click to..."
- **Measure**: Success rate, click heat maps
- **Sample Size**: 8-12 per design

### Preference Test
- **Purpose**: Compare 2-3 design variations
- **Key Rule**: Differences must be obvious to non-designers
- **Key Rule**: Randomize order shown to participants
- **Questions**: Which do you prefer? Why? Which feels more [trait]?
- **Sample Size**: 8-15 total

### Desirability Testing (Word Choice)
- **Purpose**: Verify specific brand traits are perceived
- **Method**: Closed word list (20-30 words)
- **Categories**: Target traits, opposite traits, distractors
- **Key Rule**: Allow viewing design while choosing words
- **Sample Size**: 8-20 per design

### Rating Scales
- **Purpose**: Quantitative comparison data
- **Format**: 5-point semantic differential (e.g., Cheap ←→ Premium)
- **Analysis**: Mean, median, standard deviation
- **Sample Size**: 15+ for statistical analysis

## Behavioral Methods (Observed)

Observe how users interact with the design.

### Eyetracking
- **Purpose**: Track where users look
- **Reveals**: Fixations, gaze paths, heat maps
- **Alternative**: First-click testing, recall questions

### A/B Testing
- **Purpose**: Measure real behavioral impact
- **Metrics**: CTR, conversion, time on page, bounce rate
- **Key Rule**: Change one major element at a time
- **Sample Size**: 100s-1000s (use calculators)

# Part 3: Staylook-Specific Testing

## Testing the "One Highlight" Principle

| Question | Testing Method |
|----------|----------------|
| Is THE Expressive element noticed first? | 5-second: "What stood out?" |
| Does it draw action/clicks? | First-click test |
| Is there confusion from competing elements? | Preference test: 1 highlight vs multiple |

## Testing Radius Hierarchy

| Question | Testing Method |
|----------|----------------|
| Does nesting create visual grouping? | Open word choice for "organized", "structured" |
| Is curved aesthetic perceived as warm? | Rating scale: Sharp ←→ Curved |

## Testing Standard vs Expressive Balance

| Question | Testing Method |
|----------|----------------|
| Is 90/10 ratio balanced? | Desirability testing |
| Is Expressive special and attention-grabbing? | 5-second test, first-click |

---

# Part 4: Method Selection Guide

| Goal | Best Method |
|------|-------------|
| Test first impression | 5-Second Test |
| Test findability/hierarchy | First-Click Test |
| Compare design options | Preference Testing |
| Verify brand traits perceived | Closed Word Choice |
| Discover unknown perceptions | Open Word Choice |
| Get quantitative data | Rating Scales |
| Measure real behavior | A/B Testing |
| Understand attention flow | Eyetracking |

---

# Part 5: Sample Sizes Quick Reference

| Method | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 5-Second Test | 5 | 10-15 | Per design variation |
| First-Click Test | 5 | 10-15 | Per design variation |
| Preference Test | 8 | 12-15 | Total (see all variations) |
| Open Word Choice | 8 | 15-20 | Per design variation |
| Closed Word Choice | 8 | 15-20 | Per design variation |
| Rating Scales | 15 | 30+ | For statistical analysis |
| A/B Testing | 100s-1000s | Varies | Use sample size calculator |

---

# Part 6: Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It's a Problem |
|---------|-------------------|
| Warning about 5-second tests | Primes unnatural memorization |
| Showing similar designs | Differences must be obvious to non-designers |
| Order bias | Always randomize/counterbalance design order |
| Leading questions | Don't ask "Do you like this?" |
| Small samples for quantitative | Get 15+ for rating scales |
| Aesthetic before usability | Always test behavior first in combined studies |
| Too many words in closed choice | Keep list to 20-30 words |

---

# Part 7: Best Practices

**Do**:
- Test with real target users, not colleagues
- Use structured methods, not just "do you like it?"
- Randomize order of design variations
- Allow design viewing during word selection
- Combine multiple methods for robust insights
- Test early and iterate

**Don't**:
- Assume your taste matches users
- Test subtle differences imperceptible to non-designers
- Ask about aesthetics before usability testing
- Use only one method
- Skip follow-up "why" questions
- Test once and consider it validated
